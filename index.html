        Italy, country of south-central Europe, occupying a peninsula that juts
        deep into the Mediterranean Sea. Italy comprises some of the most varied
        and scenic landscapes on Earth and is often described as a country
        shaped like a boot. At its broad top stand the Alps, which are among the
        world’s most rugged mountains. Italy’s highest points are along Monte
        Rosa, which peaks in Switzerland, and along Mont Blanc, which peaks in
        France. The western Alps overlook a landscape of Alpine lakes and
        glacier-carved valleys that stretch down to the Po River and the
        Piedmont. Tuscany, to the south of the cisalpine region, is perhaps the
        country’s best-known region. From the central Alps, running down the
        length of the country, radiates the tall Apennine Range, which widens
        near Rome to cover nearly the entire width of the Italian peninsula.
        South of Rome the Apennines narrow and are flanked by two wide coastal
        plains, one facing the Tyrrhenian Sea and the other the Adriatic Sea.
        Much of the lower Apennine chain is near-wilderness, hosting a wide
        range of species rarely seen elsewhere in western Europe, such as wild
        boars, wolves, asps, and bears. The southern Apennines are also
        tectonically unstable, with several active volcanoes, including
        Vesuvius, which from time to time belches ash and steam into the air
        above Naples and its island-strewn bay. At the bottom of the country, in
        the Mediterranean Sea, lie the islands of Sicily and Sardinia. Italy’s
        political geography has been conditioned by this rugged landscape. With
        few direct roads between them, and with passage from one point to
        another traditionally difficult, Italy’s towns and cities have a history
        of self-sufficiency, independence, and mutual mistrust. Visitors today
        remark on how unlike one town is from the next, on the marked
        differences in cuisine and dialect, and on the many subtle divergences
        that make Italy seem less a single nation than a collection of
        culturally related points in an uncommonly pleasing setting. Across a
        span of more than 3,000 years, Italian history has been marked by
        episodes of temporary unification and long separation, of intercommunal
        strife and failed empires. At peace for more than half a century now,
        Italy’s inhabitants enjoy a high standard of living and a highly
        developed culture. Though its archaeological record stretches back tens
        of thousands of years, Italian history begins with the Etruscans, an
        ancient civilization that rose between the Arno and Tiber rivers. The
        Etruscans were supplanted in the 3rd century BCE by the Romans, who soon
        became the chief power in the Mediterranean world and whose empire
        stretched from India to Scotland by the 2nd century CE. That empire was
        rarely secure, not only because of the unwillingness of conquered
        peoples to stay conquered but also because of power struggles between
        competing Roman political factions, military leaders, families, ethnic
        groups, and religions. The Roman Empire fell in the 5th century CE after
        a succession of barbarian invasions through which Huns, Lombards,
        Ostrogoths, and Franks—mostly previous subjects of Rome—seized portions
        of Italy. Rule devolved to the level of the city-state, although the
        Normans succeeded in establishing a modest empire in southern Italy and
        Sicily in the 11th century. Many of those city-states flourished during
        the Renaissance era, a time marked by significant intellectual,
        artistic, and technological advances but also by savage warfare between
        states loyal to the pope and those loyal to the Holy Roman Empire.

        Dubai, also spelled Dubayy, city and capital of the emirate of Dubai,
        one of the wealthiest of the seven emirates that constitute the
        federation of the United Arab Emirates, which was created in 1971
        following independence from Great Britain. There are several theories
        about the origin of the name Dubai. One associates it with the daba—a
        type of locust that infests the area—while another holds that it refers
        to a market that existed near the city. In recent years Dubai has been
        compared to Singapore and Hong Kong and is often regarded as the Middle
        East’s premier entrepôt. Area 13.5 square miles (35 square km). Pop.
        (2017 est.) 2,919,178. Dubai is a city of skyscrapers, ports, and
        beaches, where big business takes place alongside sun-seeking tourism.
        Because of its large expatriate population, it feels like a Middle
        Eastern melting pot, and the atmosphere is generally tolerant. Religious
        affiliations are not a prominent aspect of city life. Islam is the
        majority religion, but churches and Hindu temples coexist with Dubai’s
        mosques. Dubai is a relatively crime-free place where administrative
        efficiency and openness to business have encouraged astounding growth.
        However, criticism of Dubai’s authoritarian government and ruling elite
        is not tolerated, and there persists an atmosphere of discreet
        corruption. The western area of Dubai benefits from small stretches of
        sandy beaches, which have helped to catalyze the city’s tourism
        industry. Dubai’s rulers have sought to increase the city’s limited
        seafronts, and, in the absence of natural offshore islands, developers
        were encouraged to construct giant man-made islands off the coast of the
        city. The most famous of these is Palm Jumeirah, which has the shape of
        a palm tree. Others include the “World” islands, a cluster of small
        islands positioned to resemble a world map when viewed from above. Dubai
        straddles a natural inlet called Dubai Creek on the southern shores of
        the Persian Gulf. For more than a century, the area was Dubai’s centre,
        because of the early city’s reliance on fishing, pearl diving, and
        maritime trade. Lining the creek are the oldest buildings in Dubai, most
        of which date from the 1960s and are rarely more than two stories in
        height. In the Bastakiyyah quarter, on the western shore of the creek,
        some much older buildings have been restored, and many of these feature
        the distinctive wind tower design that was imported by Persian merchants
        early in the 20th century.

        Paris, city and capital of France, situated in the north-central part of
        the country. People were living on the site of the present-day city,
        located along the Seine River some 233 miles (375 km) upstream from the
        river’s mouth on the English Channel (La Manche), by about 7600 BCE. The
        modern city has spread from the island (the Île de la Cité) and far
        beyond both banks of the Seine. Paris occupies a central position in the
        rich agricultural region known as the Paris Basin, and it constitutes
        one of eight départements of the Île-de-France administrative region. It
        is by far the country’s most important centre of commerce and culture.
        Area city, 41 square miles (105 square km); metropolitan area, 890
        square miles (2,300 square km). Pop. (2020 est.) city, 2,145,906; (2020
        est.) urban agglomeration, 10,858,874. For centuries Paris has been one
        of the world’s most important and attractive cities. It is appreciated
        for the opportunities it offers for business and commerce, for study,
        for culture, and for entertainment; its gastronomy, haute couture,
        painting, literature, and intellectual community especially enjoy an
        enviable reputation. Its sobriquet “the City of Light” (“la Ville
        Lumière”), earned during the Enlightenment, remains appropriate, for
        Paris has retained its importance as a centre for education and
        intellectual pursuits. Paris’s site at a crossroads of both water and
        land routes significant not only to France but also to Europe has had a
        continuing influence on its growth. Under Roman administration, in the
        1st century BCE, the original site on the Île de la Cité was designated
        the capital of the Parisii tribe and territory. The Frankish king Clovis
        I had taken Paris from the Gauls by 494 CE and later made his capital
        there. Under Hugh Capet (ruled 987–996) and the Capetian dynasty the
        preeminence of Paris was firmly established, and Paris became the
        political and cultural hub as modern France took shape. France has long
        been a highly centralized country, and Paris has come to be identified
        with a powerful central state, drawing to itself much of the talent and
        vitality of the provinces.The three main parts of historical Paris are
        defined by the Seine. At its centre is the Île de la Cité, which is the
        seat of religious and temporal authority (the word cité connotes the
        nucleus of the ancient city). The Seine’s Left Bank (Rive Gauche) has
        traditionally been the seat of intellectual life, and its Right Bank
        (Rive Droite) contains the heart of the city’s economic life, but the
        distinctions have become blurred in recent decades. The fusion of all
        these functions at the centre of France and, later, at the centre of an
        empire, resulted in a tremendously vital environment. In this
        environment, however, the emotional and intellectual climate that was
        created by contending powers often set the stage for great violence in
        both the social and political arenas—the years 1358, 1382, 1588, 1648,
        1789, 1830, 1848, and 1871 being notable for such events.
